# Student Management System

This is my first project, created during my 1st semester of my Computer Science degree. The project is a **Student Management System** developed in C++. The system allows you to:

- Add, view, and delete student records.
- Add, view, and delete teacher records.
- Records are saved permanently using file handling (read/write).

## Features:
- **Student and Teacher Management**: You can manage both students and teachers by performing actions like adding, viewing, and deleting their records.
- **Permanent Data Storage**: All records are saved using file handling, ensuring the data persists even after the program is closed.
  
## Technical Details:
- **Language**: C++
- **Concepts Used**:
  - Simple loops
  - Arrays
  - Structures
  - File handling (reading and writing data)
  - Switch case
  - If-else conditions

This project helped me grasp foundational concepts in programming, and it was a great introduction to working with files and handling data in C++.
