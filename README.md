These two projects were developed during my first and second semesters as part of my Computer Science degree. As I progress in my studies, I will be uploading more projects. Continuous learning and improvement are key to my journey, and I welcome constructive feedback to help identify any mistakes and areas where I can enhance my skills.



# Student Management System

This is my first project, created during my 1st semester of my Computer Science degree. The project is a **Student Management System** developed in C++. The system allows you to:

- Add, view, and delete student records.
- Add, view, and delete teacher records.
- Records are saved permanently using file handling (read/write).

## Features:
- **Student and Teacher Management**: You can manage both students and teachers by performing actions like adding, viewing, and deleting their records.
- **Permanent Data Storage**: All records are saved using file handling, ensuring the data persists even after the program is closed.
  
## Technical Details:
- **Language**: C++
- **Concepts Used**:
  - Simple loops
  - Arrays
  - Structures
  - File handling (reading and writing data)
  - Switch case
  - If-else conditions

This project helped me grasp foundational concepts in programming, and it was a great introduction to working with files and handling data in C++.

# MediVault - Patient Management System
MediVault is a patient management system with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI), allowing users to easily manage patient records. You can add, delete, update, and view any patientâ€™s information. The system also includes a login page and a dashboard for smooth navigation and control. It connects to a MySQL database using XAMPP for efficient data storage and management.

This project was developed as part of my 2nd semester in my Computer Science degree.

# Features:
Add, update, delete, and view patient records
Secure login page
Interactive dashboard
MySQL database connection via XAMPP
# Login Credentials:
Username: shzb
Password: fraze123
You can change the login credentials using the MySQL database file provided in the project.

Included in the Project:
.jframe files for the GUI
MySQL database files
